# Config

The domains defined here can be customized by the system administrator. By default, theyâ€™re loaded from `../../group_vars/all/04_applications.yml`, but you can override them per application in your repository:

```yaml
applications:
  {{ application_id }}:
    variable_a: "test string"  # Replaces the default value
    variable_b: {}             # Merges with the existing content
    variable_c: []             # Replaces the default value (use caution with domains)
```
