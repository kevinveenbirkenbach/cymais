# Migration Feature

## Seamless Migration of Existing Software Solutions to Infinito.Nexus

Infinito.Nexus is designed to simplify the migration of existing software solutions and IT infrastructures. The focus is on protecting existing investments while enabling the benefits of a modern and unified platform.

---

## Integration of Existing Applications

Existing applications can be easily integrated into the [Infinito.Nexus](https://example.com) dashboard. There is no need to migrate or modify existing software — Infinito.Nexus provides a central interface to access and manage already deployed systems.

---

## Parallel Operation of Existing Infrastructure

Infinito.Nexus supports a parallel operation model, allowing the existing IT infrastructure to run alongside Infinito.Nexus without disruption. This enables a step-by-step migration strategy where applications and user groups can be transitioned gradually.

---

## Flexible User Management and Single Sign-On (SSO)

Infinito.Nexus offers flexible user management by supporting multiple directory services:

- [Microsoft Active Directory (AD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory)
- [LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol)

In both scenarios, centralized authentication is provided through [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), enabling modern [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) capabilities — not only for applications managed by Infinito.Nexus but also for existing external services.
