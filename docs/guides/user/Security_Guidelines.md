# Security Guidelines

CyMaIS is designed with security in mind. However, while following our guidelines can greatly improve your system‚Äôs security, no IT system can be 100% secure. Please report any vulnerabilities as soon as possible.

For optimal personal security, we **strongly recommend** the following:

- **Use a Password Manager**  
  Use a reliable password manager such as [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) üîê. (Learn more about [password managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager) on Wikipedia.) KeePass is available for both smartphones and PCs, and it can automatically generate strong, random passwords.

- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**  
  Always enable 2FA whenever possible. Many password managers (like KeePass) can generate [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-Time_Password) tokens, adding an extra layer of security even if your password is compromised.  
  Synchronize your password database across devices using the [Nextcloud Client](https://nextcloud.com/) üì±üíª.

- **Use Encrypted Systems**  
  We recommend running CyMaIS only on systems with full disk encryption. For example, Linux distributions such as [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) (based on ArchLinux) with desktop environments like [GNOME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME) provide excellent security. (Learn more about [disk encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption) on Wikipedia.)

- **Beware of Phishing and Social Engineering**  
  Always verify email senders, avoid clicking on unknown links, and never share your passwords or 2FA codes with anyone. (Learn more about [Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) and [Social Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)) on Wikipedia.)

Following these guidelines will significantly enhance your personal security‚Äîbut remember, no system is completely immune to risk.
