# Vision Statement

This is the Vision Statement for [CyMaIS](https://cymais.cloud), outlining our future goals and direction.

## Short

CyMaIS aims to empower individuals, businesses, NGOs, and enterprises with a secure, scalable, and decentralized IT infrastructure solution that ensures data sovereignty, promotes Open Source innovation, and reduces reliance on monopolistic cloud providers.

## Explanation

At the core of our mission is the development of a groundbreaking tool designed to address the inherent problems in managing IT infrastructure today, for individuals, businesses, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and large enterprises alike. From the rising costs of monopolistic cloud services to the loss of data sovereignty, security concerns, and dependency on centralized cloud providers, we aim to provide an alternative that empowers users, organizations, and businesses to regain control over their data and infrastructure.

Our vision is to create a fully automated solution that enables all users, regardless of size or industry, to establish a secure, scalable, and self-managed IT infrastructure. This tool will break down the complexities of IT infrastructure setup, making it faster, simpler, and more secure, while being accessible to everyone—from individuals and grassroots organizations to large-scale enterprises.

Grounded in Open Source principles, this solution will champion transparency, security, and innovation. It will be adaptable and flexible, offering a digital infrastructure that evolves alongside the diverse needs of businesses, organizations, and communities, all while maintaining a focus on usability and accessibility.

We envision a future where users and organizations are no longer at the mercy of monopolistic cloud providers, where they can securely manage their own data and infrastructure. This future will see individuals and NGOs empowered with the same capabilities as large enterprises—ensuring that people of all scales can maintain control and sovereignty over their digital lives, free from external manipulation.

CyMaIS will democratize access to advanced IT infrastructure solutions, providing security, flexibility, and scalability for all—from small NGOs to large multinational enterprises—without the cost and dependence on centralized, proprietary cloud services. By utilizing Open Source, our solution will meet the highest standards of security while fostering a collaborative, community-driven approach to innovation and continuous improvement.

Moreover, our vision goes beyond just IT infrastructure; it extends to the broader goal of democratizing the internet itself. By integrating decentralized protocols like **ActivityPub**, **email**, and **Matrix**, we aim to restore the foundational principles of a decentralized, resilient internet. In today’s world, marked by political tensions, wars, and uncertainty, the importance of resilient, distributed infrastructures has never been greater. CyMaIS will enable all users—from individuals to NGOs and large enterprises—to remain independent and secure, ensuring that control over data and communications stays in their hands, not under the dominance of monopolistic entities.

Ultimately, our vision is to redefine the way IT infrastructure is deployed and managed, offering a solution that is swift, secure, and scalable, capable of meeting the needs of businesses, individuals, NGOs, and large enterprises. CyMaIS will empower all stakeholders by providing a foundation for a decentralized, transparent, and resilient digital future—setting a new benchmark for security, reliability, and sovereignty in the digital age.
