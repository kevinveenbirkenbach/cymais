# Installation

CyMaIS can be easily installed on your local host using [Kevin's Package Manager](https://github.com/kevinveenbirkenbach/package-manager). Once you have the package manager set up, simply run:

```bash
pkgmgr clone cymais     # downloads the cymais repository
pkgmgr install cymais   # installs cymais on your local host
```

This command will install CyMaIS on your system with the alias **cymais**.
