## What is CyMaIS? 📌
CyMaIS is an automated, modular infrastructure framework built on Docker, Linux, and Ansible, equally suited for cloud services, local server management, and desktop workstations. At its core lies a web-based desktop with single sign-on—backed by an LDAP directory and OIDC—granting seamless access to an almost limitless portfolio of self-hosted applications. It fully supports ActivityPub applications and is Fediverse-compatible, while integrated monitoring, alerting, cleanup, self-healing, automated updates, and backup solutions provide everything an organization needs to run at scale.
