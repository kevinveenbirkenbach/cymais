## What is Infinito.Nexus? 📌

**Infinito.Nexus** is an **automated, modular infrastructure framework** built on **Docker**, **Linux**, and **Ansible**, equally suited for cloud services, local server management, and desktop workstations. At its core lies a **web-based desktop with single sign-on**—backed by an **LDAP directory** and **OIDC**—granting **seamless access** to an almost limitless portfolio of self-hosted applications. It fully supports **ActivityPub applications** and is **Fediverse-compatible**, while integrated **monitoring**, **alerting**, **cleanup**, **self-healing**, **automated updates**, and **backup solutions** provide everything an organization needs to run at scale.
