# Refint Overlay Configuration for OpenLDAP
#
# This file configures the refint overlay for the specified LDAP database.
#
# The overlay is applied to the database (here using the "hdb" backend) and is
# responsible for maintaining referential integrity.
#
# The attribute "olcRefintAttribute" lists the attributes that will be monitored
# for changes. In this case, changes to the following attributes will be tracked:
#   - memberof
#   - member
#   - manager
#   - owner
#
# This ensures that any changes in the LDAP directory (such as deletion or modification
# of an object) automatically update all references to that object, preventing dangling references.
