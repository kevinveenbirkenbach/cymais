# Backup Remote to Local

## Description

This role pulls backups from a remote server and stores them locally using rsync with retry logic. It is designed to retrieve remote backup data and integrate with your overall backup scheme.

## Overview

Optimized for Archlinux, this role is a key component of a comprehensive backup system. It works in conjunction with other roles to ensure that backup data is collected, verified, and maintained. The role uses a Bash script to pull backups, manage remote connections, and handle incremental backup creation.
