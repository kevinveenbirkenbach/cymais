# Package Manager Installation üì¶

## Description

This Ansible role installs [Kevin's Package Manager](https://github.com/kevinveenbirkenbach/package-manager) and updates packages using `pkgmgr` on Arch Linux systems. It provides a unified interface for package installation and update management, ensuring consistent deployment across environments.

## Overview

The role abstracts package management operations using `pkgmgr`. It ensures the package manager itself is updated once per run and provides idempotent installation and update routines for specified packages.

## Purpose

The purpose of this role is to automate the installation and update process for CyMaIS-related applications or other managed packages using `pkgmgr`. It simplifies package handling and enforces best practices for package deployment in automated environments.

## Features

- **Automatic pkgmgr Update:** Ensures the package manager is always up-to-date.
- **Idempotent Package Installation:** Only installs packages when necessary.
- **Flexible Notification:** Supports handler notification for post-install actions (e.g., Docker Compose builds).
- **Optional Privilege Escalation:** Controlled via the `pkgmgr_become` variable (default: `true`).
