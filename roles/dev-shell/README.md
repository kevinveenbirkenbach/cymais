# Shell 🐚

## Description

This Ansible role ensures that [.profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell#Startup_scripts) is sourced in both [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) environments. It enables consistent environment variable loading across different login shells by linking shell-specific profile files (`.bash_profile`, `.zprofile`) to a centralized `.profile`.

## Overview

By standardizing `.profile` as the central source for environment configuration, this role ensures consistent shell behavior. It does **not** manage the contents of `.profile` itself — only guarantees that it is sourced by supported shells.

## Purpose

The purpose of this role is to unify shell environment setup across Bash and Zsh. It minimizes duplication and confusion by encouraging the use of `.profile` for shared configuration such as environment variables and agent settings.

## Features

- **Centralized Configuration:** Promotes `.profile` as the single source for shared shell settings.
- **Cross-Shell Compatibility:** Ensures both Bash and Zsh source `.profile` properly.
- **Non-Invasive:** Does not alter the content of `.profile`.
