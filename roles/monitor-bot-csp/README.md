# Health CSP Crawler

## Description

This Ansible role automates the validation of [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) enforcement for all configured domains by crawling them using a [CSP Checker](https://github.com/kevinveenbirkenbach/csp-checker).

## Overview

Designed for Archlinux systems, this role periodically checks whether web resources (JavaScript, fonts, images, etc.) are blocked by CSP headers. It integrates Python and Node.js tooling and installs a systemd service with timer support.

## Features

- **CSP Resource Validation:** Uses Puppeteer to simulate browser requests and detect blocked resources.
- **Domain Extraction:** Parses all `.conf` files in the NGINX config folder to determine the list of domains to check.
- **Automated Execution:** Registers a systemd service and timer for recurring health checks.
- **Error Notification:** Integrates with `alert-compose` for alerting on failure.
