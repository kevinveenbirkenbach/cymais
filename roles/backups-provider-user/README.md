# Backups Provider User

## Description

This role sets up a dedicated backup user (`backup`) for performing secure backup operations. It creates the user, configures a restricted SSH environment with a custom `authorized_keys` template and an SSH wrapper script, and grants necessary sudo rights for executing rsync. This configuration helps ensure controlled and secure access specifically for backup processes.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The role is a critical component in a secure backup scheme. By isolating backup operations to a dedicated user, it minimizes the risk of unauthorized actions. The role configures the SSH environment so that only specific, allowed commands can be executed, and it sets up passwordless sudo rights for rsync, ensuring smooth and secure backup operations.

## Purpose

The purpose of this role is to enhance the security of your backup system by providing a dedicated user with strict command restrictions. This controlled environment limits the potential damage from a compromised backup account while still allowing efficient backup operations.

## Features

- **User Creation:** Creates a dedicated `backup` user with a home directory.
- **SSH Environment Setup:** Establishes a secure `.ssh` directory and deploys a restricted `authorized_keys` file via a Jinja2 template.
- **SSH Wrapper Script:** Implements a custom SSH wrapper that logs and filters incoming SSH commands, enforcing security policies.
- **Sudo Configuration:** Grants passwordless sudo rights for rsync, enabling secure and automated backup transfers.
- **Integration:** Supports seamless integration with your backup infrastructure by limiting the backup user's permissions to only the required commands.
