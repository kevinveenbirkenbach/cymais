# Nginx Global Matomo & Theming Modifier Role ðŸš€

This role enhances your Nginx configuration by conditionally injecting global Matomo tracking and theming elements into your HTML responses. It uses Nginx sub-filters to seamlessly add tracking scripts and CSS links to your web pages.

---

## Features

- **Global Matomo Tracking**  
  When enabled (`global_matomo_tracking_enabled` is `true`), the role includes Matomo tracking configuration and injects the corresponding tracking script into your HTML.

- **Global Theming**  
  When enabled (`global_theming_enabled` is `true`), the role injects a global CSS link for consistent theming across your site.

- **Smart Injection**  
  Uses Nginx's `sub_filter` to insert the tracking and theming snippets right before the closing `</head>` tag of your HTML documents.


This will automatically activate Matomo tracking and/or global theming based on your configuration.
