## Setup

### Fetchmail Issues

Fetchmail might not work properly with large amounts of data. For more information, refer to this [issue](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1719).

#### Deactivating Fetchmail

Before uninstalling Fetchmail, ensure you remove all fetched accounts from the administration panel.

#### Fetchmail Security Concerns

There are known security concerns with Fetchmail as stated in the [German Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetchmail). If you require Fetchmail functions in the future, consider creating a Docker container for [Getmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getmail) as it is considered more secure.

#### Fetchmail Workaround

If you need to receive emails from another account, follow these steps:

1. Redirect your emails to your new email account.
2. Export all data from your original account.
3. Import all data to your new account.

### Data Deletion

To delete all volumes and data, execute the following command with caution:

```bash
rm -vr /etc/mailu/; docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q | grep mailu_)
```

### Port Management

Check for any port conflicts and manually change the conflicting ports if necessary. Use the following command to verify:

```bash
netstat -tulpn
```

### Admin Account Creation

To use Mailu, create the primary administrator user account, `admin@{{hostname}}`, using the command below. Replace `PASSWORD` with your preferred password:

```bash
docker-compose -p mailu exec admin flask mailu admin {{admin}} {{hostname}} PASSWORD
```

### CLI User Management

For managing users, follow the instructions in the official [Mailu CLI documentation](https://mailu.io/master/cli.html).

### Starting the Server

To start the server, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -p mailu up -d
```

## Debugging

### Database Access

To access the database, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose exec -it database mysql -u root -D mailu -p
```

### Container Access

To access the front container, use this command:

```bash
docker-compose exec -it front /bin/bash
```

### Restarting Services

To restart all services, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose restart 
```

### Resending Queued Mails

To resend queued mails, use this command:

```bash
docker-compose exec -it smtp postqueue -f
```

## Testing

Use the following tools for testing:

- SSL-Tools Mailserver Test (URL: https://de.ssl-tools.net/mailservers/)
- TestEmail.de (URL: http://testemail.de/)

## Updates

For instructions on updating your Mailu setup, follow the official [Mailu maintenance guide](https://mailu.io/master/maintain.html).

## Queue Management

To manage the Postfix email queue in Mailu, you can use the following commands:

- **Display the email queue**: This command shows all queued emails.
  ```bash
  docker compose exec -it smtp postqueue -p
  ```

- **Delete all emails in the queue**: To remove all queued emails permanently, use the command:
  ```bash
  docker compose exec -it smtp postsuper -d ALL
  ```

These commands can help control the email queue, especially for clearing out emails with delivery issues or delays.

## Spam Issues

### Inspect

Use the following tools to monitor your domain and email deliverability:

- [Google Postmaster](https://postmaster.google.com/) - Analyzes deliverability and spam issues for Gmail.
- [Yahoo Postmaster](https://postmaster.yahooinc.com) - Provides insights and delivery reports for Yahoo.

### Blacklist Check

If your domain is blacklisted, you can check the status with these services and take steps to remove your domain if necessary:

- [Spamhaus](https://check.spamhaus.org/) - One of the most widely used blacklists for spam.
- [Barracuda](https://www.barracudacentral.org/lookups) - Checks if your IP is on the Barracuda blacklist.

### Cloudmark Reset Request

If your IP or domain is flagged by Cloudmark, you can submit a **reset request** to help restore deliverability:

- [Cloudmark Reset](https://csi.cloudmark.com/en/reset/)
