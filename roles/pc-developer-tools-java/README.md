# PC-Developer-Tools-Java Role

## Overview
Welcome to the `pc-developer-tools-java` role, a part of the `cymais` repository. This role is specifically designed for setting up Java development tools on personal computers. It is an essential component for Java developers, providing the necessary tools and dependencies for efficient Java development.

## Role Dependencies
This role has dependencies on two other roles within the playbook:
1. **Java**: Ensures that Java, specifically the JDK (Java Development Kit), is installed and configured on the system. This is a critical prerequisite for running and developing Java applications.
2. **PC-Developer-Tools**: Establishes a base environment of developer tools which might include code editors, version control systems, and other utilities beneficial for a broad range of development activities.

## Purpose and Usage
The `pc-developer-tools-java` role is tailored to meet the needs of Java developers by ensuring that their systems are equipped with all necessary Java-specific tools. This role is particularly useful for software engineers, application developers, and students working with Java.

## Prerequisites
- **Ansible**: You must have Ansible installed on your system to use this role.
- **Appropriate Operating System**: While the role itself doesn't specify system requirements, the dependencies, especially the Java role, may be tailored for specific distributions like Arch Linux. Ensure your system is compatible with these requirements.

## Running the Role
To utilize this role:
1. Ensure the `cymais` repository is cloned to your machine.
2. Verify that the dependencies (`java` and `pc-developer-tools`) are correctly set up and configured in your playbook.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `pc-developer-tools-java` role.
4. Execute the role using Ansible. Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions and environment for installing and configuring the development tools.

## Customization
You may customize this role by adding additional Java development tools or adjusting configurations to better suit your specific development needs.

## Support and Contributions
For support, feedback, or contributions to this role, such as adding more Java-related tools or enhancing the setup process, please open an issue or submit a pull request in the `cymais` repository. Contributions that improve the Java development environment setup are highly encouraged.
