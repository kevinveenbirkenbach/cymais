# Fakeroot

## Description

This Ansible role installs **fakeroot** on Arch Linux systems using the Pacman package manager. Fakeroot enables non-privileged users to simulate root-level file manipulationsâ€”ideal for building packages or performing file operations that normally require root permissions.

## Features

- **Automated Installation:** Uses Pacman to install fakeroot.
