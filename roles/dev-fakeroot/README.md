# Fakeroot

## Description

This Ansible role installs **fakeroot** on Arch Linux systems using the Pacman package manager. Fakeroot enables non-privileged users to simulate root-level file manipulations—ideal for building packages or performing file operations that normally require root permissions.

## Purpose

## Features

- **Automated Installation:** Uses Pacman to install fakeroot.
- **Idempotent Execution:** Ensures that fakeroot is installed and remains up to date.
- **Simplified Setup:** Minimizes manual installation steps for environments where fakeroot is required.
