# Nginx Docker Reverse Proxy 🚀

## Description

This Ansible role deploys **Nginx** as a high-performance [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) in front of Docker-hosted services.  
It provides automatic TLS integration, WebSocket support, and a flexible templating system for per-application configuration.

## Overview

Optimised for Arch Linux, the role installs Nginx, prepares opinionated configuration snippets and exposes a simple interface for other roles to drop in new virtual-hosts.  
It plays well with **Let’s Encrypt**, **OAuth2 Proxy**, and your existing Docker stack.

## Purpose

The goal of this role is to deliver a **hassle-free, production-ready reverse proxy** for self-hosted containers, suitable for homelabs and small-scale production workloads.

## Features

- **Automatic TLS & HSTS** — integrates with the *srv-web-7-6-https* role for certificate management.  
- **Flexible vHost templates** — *basic* and *ws_generic* flavours cover standard HTTP and WebSocket applications.  
- **Security headers** — sensible defaults plus optional X-Frame-Options / CSP based on application settings.  
- **WebSocket & HTTP/2 aware** — upgrades, keep-alive tuning, and gzip already configured.  
- **OAuth2 gating** — drop-in support when *web-app-oauth2-proxy* is present.  
- **Modular includes** — headers, locations, and global snippets are factored for easy extension.
