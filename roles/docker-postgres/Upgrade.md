# PostgreSQL Docker Upgrade: Major Version Migration

This guide explains how to safely upgrade a PostgreSQL Docker container from one major version to another (e.g., version 12 to 16) using a **dump and restore** method. This is the recommended approach in Docker environments.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important
PostgreSQL data directories are **not compatible across major versions**. You cannot just point a newer version to the old data volume. You must export and re-import your data.

## Backup
First do a backup

## Restore
Setup new Version and apply restore_postgres_databases.py.
