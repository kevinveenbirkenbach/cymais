# Role Administrator
This role creates an standard administrator user.
This user needs to type in his password before executing sudo.
For security reasons it's recommended to use this user instead of the standard root user.
This user should not be used to login to other systems. It's just there to let administration tasks run.
For this reason no ssh-keys are generated.
