# - EMAIL_CONFIG and DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL if you plan to send e-mails)
# On non-docker setup **only**, you'll also have to tweak/uncomment those variables:
# - DATABASE_URL
# - CACHE_URL
#
# You **don't** need to update those variables on pure docker setups.

# Additional options you may want to check:
# - MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH and MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH if you plan to use

# Configure e-mail sending using this variale
# By default, funkwhale will output e-mails sent to stdout
# here are a few examples for this setting
# EMAIL_CONFIG=consolemail://         # output e-mails to console (the default)
# EMAIL_CONFIG=dummymail://          # disable e-mail sending completely
# On a production instance, you'll usually want to use an external SMTP server:
# If `user` or `password` contain special characters (eg.
# `noreply@youremail.host` as `user`), be sure to urlencode them, using
# for example the command:
# `python3 -c 'import urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.quote_plus
# ("noreply@youremail.host"))'`
# (returns `noreply%40youremail.host`)
# EMAIL_CONFIG=smtp://user:password@youremail.host:25
