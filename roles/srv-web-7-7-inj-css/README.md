# 🌍 Global CSS Injection for Nginx

## Description

This Ansible role ensures **consistent global theming** across all Nginx-served applications by injecting a unified `global.css` file.  
The role leverages [`colorscheme-generator`](https://github.com/kevinveenbirkenbach/colorscheme-generator/) to generate a dynamic, customizable color palette for light and dark mode, compatible with popular web tools like **Bootstrap**, **Keycloak**, **Nextcloud**, **Taiga**, **Mastodon**, and many more.

## Overview

This role deploys a centralized global stylesheet (`global.css`) that overrides the default theming of web applications served via Nginx. It's optimized to run only once per deployment and generates a **cache-busting version number** based on file modification timestamps.  
It includes support for **dark mode**, **custom fonts**, and **extensive Bootstrap and UI component overrides**.

## Purpose

The goal of this role is to provide a **single source of truth for theming** across your infrastructure.  
It makes all applications feel like part of the same ecosystem — visually and functionally.
