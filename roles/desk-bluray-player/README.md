# desk-bluray-player

## Description

This Ansible role installs and configures all the software required for Blu-ray playback on Arch Linux–based systems. It ensures that VLC and the necessary libraries for Blu-ray disc decryption and playback (`libaacs`, `libbluray`) are present, and provides hooks for optional AUR packages.

## Overview

- Uses the `community.general.pacman` module to install:
  - `vlc` (media player with Blu-ray support)  
  - `libaacs` (AACS decryption library)  
  - `libbluray` (Blu-ray playback support library)  
- Contains commented-out tasks for optional AUR packages (`aacskeys`, `libbdplus`) you can enable as needed.
- Designed for idempotent execution on Arch Linux and derivatives.

## Features

- **VLC Installation**  
  Installs `vlc` for general media and Blu-ray playback.

  Drop-in tasks for `aacskeys` and `libbdplus` via AUR (commented out by default).

- **Idempotent Role**  
  Safe to run multiple times without unintended side effects.

- **Arch Linux–Optimized**
