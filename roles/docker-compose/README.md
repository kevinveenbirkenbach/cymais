# Docker Compose üß±

## Description

This Ansible role manages Docker Compose project structures and workflows for applications on Arch Linux. It creates dedicated instance directories, manages `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` files, and provides automation logic for project reset, rebuild, and startup sequences.

Refer to the [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), the [Arch Wiki ‚Äì Docker](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Docker), and [Compose CLI reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/) for more details.

## Overview

This role creates a flexible directory layout for managing Docker Compose projects across environments. It ensures directories are initialized, optionally reset, and kept clean using internal flags like `mode_reset` or `mode_cleanup`.

## Purpose

To offer a centralized, extensible system for managing containerized applications using Docker Compose within the CyMaIS architecture. The role allows easy integration of services, secrets, configurations, and custom behaviors per application.

## Features

- **Dynamic Directory Structure:** Creates per-application instance folders for Compose setups.
- **Reset Logic:** Cleans previous Compose project files and data when `mode_reset` is enabled.
- **Handlers for Runtime Control:** Automatically builds, sets up, or restarts containers based on handlers.
- **Template-ready Service Files:** Predefined service base and health check templates.
- **Integration Support:** Compatible with `nginx-docker-reverse-proxy` and other CyMaIS service roles.
