# Nginx HTTPS Certificate Retrieval

## ðŸ”¥ Description

This role automates the retrieval of [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL/TLS certificates using [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) for domains served via Nginx. It supports both single-domain and wildcard certificates, and can use either the DNS or webroot ACME challenge methods.

## ðŸ“– Overview

Designed for Archlinux systems, this role handles issuing certificates per domain and optionally cleans up redundant certificates if wildcard certificates are used. It intelligently decides whether to issue a standard or wildcard certificate based on the domain structure and your configuration.

### Key Features
- **Single Domain and Wildcard Support:** Handles both individual domains and wildcard domains (`*.example.com`).
- **DNS and Webroot Challenges:** Dynamically selects the correct ACME challenge method.
- **Certificate Renewal Logic:** Skips renewal if the certificate is still valid.
- **Optional Cleanup:** Deletes redundant domain certificates when wildcard certificates are used.
- **Non-Interactive Operation:** Fully automated using `--non-interactive` and `--agree-tos`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The Nginx HTTPS Certificate Retrieval role ensures that your Nginx-served domains have valid, automatically issued SSL/TLS certificates, improving web security without manual intervention.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **ACME Challenge Selection:** Supports DNS plugins or webroot method automatically.
- **Wildcard Certificate Management:** Issues wildcard certificates when configured, saving effort for subdomain-heavy deployments.
- **Safe Cleanup:** Ensures that no unused certificates are left behind.
- **Flexible Control:** Supports `mode_test` for staging environment testing and `mode_cleanup` for cert cleanup operations.
